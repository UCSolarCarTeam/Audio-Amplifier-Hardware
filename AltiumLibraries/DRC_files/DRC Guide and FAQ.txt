A word of warning:

                                                  *** THE DRC PROTECTS YOUR DESIGN ***

Please do not create a DRC Add-On without thorough knowledge of the DRC system. Doing so may result in unanticipated
build-errors or manufacturing defects.

What is DRC?

- DRC stands for Design Rule Check. The rules specified dictate how your PCB can be made, and what tolerances you cannot violate.
  It is crucial to creating a manufacturable and electrically stable PCB.
- A DRC file is the exported format of the rules, allowing them to be shared and stored. For Altium, the file extension
  is <.RUL>


What is a Primary DRC file?

- The DRC rules can be imported and exported from your project. I have created a Master DRC Rule file which dictates how
  our team's PCBs should be made, which I have named the 'Primary DRC file'. You can customize these rules locally in your
  project, but it is **mandatory** to use the Primary DRC files to ensure a high level of quality control in the boards that
  we produce.


What is a DRC Add-On file?

- A DRC Add-On file is simply a DRC file with only a portion of all the rules. It is meant to be appended to the
  Primary DRC file, to allow for specific changes.
- By having two separate files, you can maintain local custom rules, while still getting relevant updates to all other DRC rules
    from the GitHub Repository.


Primary Rules of Use:

- Primary DRC files must be used for PCB design by default. They are maintained in <AltiumLibraries/DRC_files>.
    -> This ensures that common design standards are followed among all Solar Car PCB designers, and avoids variance among
       new designers with less knowledge of the DRC system.
- Rule Add-On files are meant to compliment the primary DRC file.
    -> Add-On files should be created if design exceptions warrant custom DRC rules that diverge from the primary DRC file.
        eg) Larger clearance requirements than normal, unusual trace width, etc.
- Projects should be limited to using exactly one Primary DRC file, and a maximum of one Add-On file.


Naming Convention:

    - Add-On files should be named by taking the project name (filename with .PrjPcb extension), and appending (_DRCadd), with
      the file extension (.RUL).
       eg) if a project file is named 'DCDC-Converter.PrjPcb', the Add-On file will be named 'DCDC-Converter_DRCadd.RUL'.


File Location:
    - The Add-On file should be located in your project directory, along with schematic and
      PCB files (.SchDoc and .PcbDoc extensions).


How to Use the Primary DRC and Add-On files:

1) Check for AltiumLibraries Repository Update.
2) Update your DRC.
       a) Open your PCB document. Navigate to 'Design' in the top horizontal toolbar. Select 'Rules...' from the dropdown.
          Alternatively, click the working area of your PCB document (where the PCB is) and hit <D> then <R> on your keyboard.
          (You must be in 2D or 3D view for this macro to work. Do so by hitting <2> or <3> along the top number keys
          of your keyboard).
       b) You should now be in the 'PCB Rules and Constraints Editor'. Right-click on the whitespace in the left column.
          Select 'Import Rules' from the dropdown.
       c) Highlight EVERY item in the window that opens, and click 'OK'.
       d) Navigate to the AltiumLibraries/DRC_files folder. This should be a submodule of your project. Select a suitable
          Primary DRC (likely manufacturer-specific). Click 'OK'.

3) Now for the Add-On file! (Note that steps 1) -> 2d) apply for every project which uses the Primary DRC file.)
   Repeat step 2), and substitute your Add-On file instead of the files contained in <AltiumLibraries/DRC_files>.
4) Note that you must do the DRC import in this order. Otherwise, your custom Add-On DRC will be completely overwritten by the
   Primary DRC file.
5) You have successfully updated your DRC!
